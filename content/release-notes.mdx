  - Masks password/secret-like fields generically (by key patterns and schema type/format) — never rendered.
  - For models that extend a base, if `baseId` is hydrated, its fields are merged into the view (the link field is hidden).

  - Added buildPredicateForField to build robust filters for string/number/boolean/date/objectId and arrays.
