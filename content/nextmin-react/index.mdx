# nextmin-react

React components, pages, and utilities for building an admin dashboard on top of a nextmin-node backend.

## Features

- Provider: `<NextMinProvider>` initializes the Redux store, loads schemas, and opens a live socket
- Admin shell: `<AdminApp>` renders Auth, Sidebar, and all CRUD pages for your schemas
- Internal router: `<NextMinRouter>` and `<AdminRouteNormalizer>` handle admin routes
- Pages: Auth (sign in/up/forgot), Dashboard, List, Create/Edit, Profile, Settings
- Components: Sidebar, SchemaForm, FileUploader, Ref selects, Phone/Password inputs, Table and filters
- Hooks/Utils: Google address autocomplete, list data helpers, formatting helpers

This page shows the exact setup used in the examples/react app.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @airoom/nextmin-react

# yarn
yarn add @airoom/nextmin-react

# pnpm
pnpm add @airoom/nextmin-react
```

## Configure environment

The client reads these env vars:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXTMIN_API_URL=http://localhost:8081/rest
# IMPORTANT: Use the API key stored in your database → Settings table
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXTMIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

- NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXTMIN_API_URL should point to your nextmin-node REST base (e.g., http://host:port/rest)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXTMIN_API_KEY must equal the value in your DB Settings document’s `apiKey` field

Where to find it:
- Start your nextmin-node server once so initialization runs
- Open your database and locate the Settings collection/table
- Copy the first Settings document’s `apiKey` value and use it here

## Default admin credentials (after setup)

After you complete the basic setup and run the server, you can sign in to the Admin with the following default super user:

- Email: super@example.com
- Username: superadmin
- Password: supersecurepassword

For security, make sure to change this password after your first login (Profile → Change password) and, if needed, update the email/username in your Users collection.

## App routing (as in examples/react)

Create an admin section that’s fully client-side. The provider wraps only the admin area.

```tsx
// app/admin/layout.tsx
'use client'

import { NextMinProvider } from '@airoom/nextmin-react';

export default function AdminLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <NextMinProvider>{children}</NextMinProvider>;
}
```

```tsx
// app/admin/page.tsx
'use client'

import { AdminApp } from '@airoom/nextmin-react';

export default function AdminIndex() {
  return <AdminApp />;
}
```

```tsx
// app/admin/[...slug]/page.tsx
'use client'

import { AdminApp } from '@airoom/nextmin-react';

export default function AdminCatchAll() {
  return <AdminApp />;
}
```

What this gives you:

- AdminApp reads the session from localStorage and redirects:
  - Unauthenticated users are sent to /admin/auth/sign-in
  - Authenticated users visiting /admin/auth/* are redirected to /admin/dashboard
- Inside the shell, Sidebar is shown and NextMinRouter renders pages based on your backend schemas
- Schemas are fetched once via HTTP and then kept in sync over a live socket

## Usage notes

- You don’t need to import any CSS manually; the package includes its styles
- Backend paths and auth are configured by env vars (see above)
- To add custom pages inside the admin, link to routes like /admin/your-model/create or /admin/your-model/:id
- The first Settings document (model name "Settings") is treated as system settings for logo, site name, and Google Maps key

## Form Features (SchemaForm)

The `SchemaForm` component drastically reduces boilerplate by rendering forms from JSON schemas.

- **Auto Slug Generation**: Use `populateSlugFrom: "title"` in your schema to automatically generate URL-friendly slugs. It handles uniqueness (appending `-1`, `-2`) and supports multi-field sources (`populateSlugFrom: "firstName,lastName"`).
- **Reference Selects**:
  - `RefSingleSelect`: Searchable dropdown with alphabetical sorting.
  - `RefMultiSelect`: Tag-based multi-select with search and sorting.
- **Rich Text**: Fields with `rich: true` render a Tiptap-based editor with slash commands.

## Viewer (Drawer)

We ship a schema-driven, reusable viewer that opens in a right-side Drawer from list rows. It:

- Adds a View (eye) icon next to Edit/Delete in tables
- Hides system/private fields and masks any password/secret-like fields
- Merges `baseId` object data into the child for viewing when schemas extend others
- Summarizes raw JSON values (including JSON strings) into readable lines

See details and API: [Viewer (Drawer)](/docs/nextmin-react/viewer)

## TypeScript

Types are bundled with the package.

```text
import type { ApiItemResponse } from '@airoom/nextmin-react/types';
```
