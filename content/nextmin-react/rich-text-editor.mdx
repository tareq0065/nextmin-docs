# Rich Text Editor

Nextmin React includes a powerful, block-based rich text editor built on top of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/). It supports standard text formatting, slash commands, image uploads, and advanced layout options.

## Enabling the Editor

To use the rich text editor for a field in your schema, simply set the `rich` property to `true` for a `string` type field:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "type": "string",
    "rich": true,
    "title": "Content Body"
  }
}
```

## Features

### Slash Commands
Type `/` in an empty paragraph to open the command menu. This allows you to quickly insert:
- **Headings**: H1, H2, H3
- **Lists**: Bullet and Numbered lists
- **Media**: Images
- **Layouts**: 2-Column and 3-Column blocks
- **Embeds**: Embed other schema data (Tables, Lists, etc.)

### Image Management
The editor supports drag-and-drop image uploads and standard file selection.
- **Resizing**: Click and drag the handles to resize images.
- **Formatting**: Click an image to open the floating menu. You can set the alignment and `object-fit` styles (Cover, Contain, Fill).

### Layouts & Grids
Create complex page structures using the Layout commands.
- **2 Columns**: Splits the content area into two equal columns.
- **3 Columns**: Splits the content area into three equal columns.

### Schema Embedding
You can embed data from other collections directly into your content. This is useful for creating dynamic pages that reference other records.
